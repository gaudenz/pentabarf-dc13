-- As requested by Richard Darst:
--
-- This does two things:
-- - change conference_id to 5 in two places
-- - add cp.arrived to the query (request since last year)
--
-- The view definition this is based off of was found from \d debconf.dc_view_numbers

-- This fixes the "accomodation" misspelling everywhere it occurs.  Will this cause any problems?
-- Might want to save this one until Ganneff can approve.
